# dndLootTable
This is the final project for CS2 
## What?
This project will be a DND Loot Table for dungeonmasters
## Why?
Several dungeonmasters running their game will have a hard time generating loot for players. With this application we hope to ease dungeonmasters into loot generation
## How?
This loot table will prompt the user to input the difficult of the encounter or the rarity of the loot chest. It will then output the randomized loot included in the encounter. 
## Deliverables
